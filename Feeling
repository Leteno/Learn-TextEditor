in the future

The author is so nice to describe everything in details
I am fully moved by his generousness and kindness.

Looking back for what influence me most.

I guest it is the code structure.

The author use structure like this, to organize all the code in a file
```
/*** data ***/
/*** main ***/
```

It is so hard to read a file with a lot of code(for me).
And I used to seperate it into serveral pieces,
Now I get another solution, fragment it.


BTW, the comment is important, too. I used to believe that good variable name
will keep the comments away. However, you need to read the code though.

With comment, you can just ignore(summerize) the code, and have a brief idea of these code.
However comment should be short and strick into point.

Especially in the option. Who can know what the difference between `ICANON` and `IEXTEN`?
